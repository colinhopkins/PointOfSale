# Self Checkout Kiosk

Welcome to the self checkout kiosk project! This project aims to develop software for a self checkout kiosk without the use of conditionals. The user/customer will input the numeric barcode for each item they want to purchase, and the items will be displayed along with their prices.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

Develop software for a self checkout kiosk
Apply object-oriented programming concepts
Implement a class to represent the types of items for sale in the store
Implement a class for the self checkout machine that can scan these items
Add modifiers to item prices, such as sales, taxes, and bottle deposits
Complete the customer experience of purchasing items using the self checkout machine
Implement a loyalty program where loyalty sales are active for all purchases of an item with a LoyaltySale added of a type, even if they were scanned before the loyalty card button was pressed.

## Usage

To use this self checkout kiosk, follow these steps:

Scan each item using its numeric barcode
The items and their prices will be displayed on the screen
The final price of each item will be computed based on any modifiers, such as sales, taxes, and bottle deposits
Once all items have been scanned, press the "Finish" button to complete the purchase
If you have a loyalty program card, press the "Loyalty Card" button to activate the loyalty sales for all eligible items

## Implementation

The self checkout kiosk software is developed without using any conditionals. Instead, object-oriented programming approaches are used to make decisions based on the types of objects stored in variables.
